# HomeDash

## Requirements

At least Java 11, work to make it works with Java 17 is ongoing.

### Build

1. Java SDK 11
2. Maven

### Run

1. Java 11

## Run from distribution

### From JAR file

Download the latest Homedash-version.jar from the [release page](https://github.com/lamarios/Homedash2/releases).

First time you run the application, you'll need to generate a config file.
```
java -jar Homedash-{version}.jar -create-config
```

This will create a config file that you can modify in your current working directory.

You can then run 
```
java -Dconfig.file=./homedash.properties -jar Homedash-{version}.jar
```

### From docker

You can run homedash using docker.

```
docker run -t --name homedash \
        -v "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro" \
        -v "/your/path/to/save/data:/data" \
        -e "SALT=somerandomstring" \
        -p "4567:4567" \
        gonzague/homedash
```
Environment Variables:

| Variable | Description | Required |
